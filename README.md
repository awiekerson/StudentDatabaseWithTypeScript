<b> Student Database with FIlters </b> 

I developed a dynamic student database that reads and parses data from a JSON file to automatically populate student 
information. The system includes 5 distinct filters that accurately display students based on various criteria. 
I designed the filtering functionality to be highly efficient and to minimizing code redundancy while 
ensuring adaptability across different filter combinations. 

In the future, I plan to add checkboxes for the different areas of focus that can be combined with any other filter, offering flexible and precise filtering 
options.
