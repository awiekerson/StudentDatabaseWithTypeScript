<b> Student Database with FIlters </b> 

I developed a dynamic student database that reads and parses data from a JSON file to automatically populate student 
information. The system includes 8 distinct filters that accurately display students based on various criteria. 
Users can combine checkboxes for different areas of focus with any other filter, offering flexible and precise filtering 
options. I designed the filtering functionality to be highly efficient and to minimizing code redundancy while 
ensuring adaptability across different filter combinations.
